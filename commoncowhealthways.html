    <p>Poor health status and subclinical disease can be a major cause of financial losses on many beef and dairy farms. The impact of many diseases can be avoided or minimised by reducing exposure to disease pathogens (effective biosecurity) and implementing effective vaccination programmes. Vaccination programmes should be designed for the individual farm and included in the herd health plan.

    <p>When treatments are necessary there is a joint responsibility between the veterinary surgeon and the farmer to ensure that antimicrobial drugs are used correctly and that all legal requirements are met.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Prescribing categories</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Prescription Only Medicine-Veterinarian (POM-V)</li>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">POM-V</h2>

    <P>
        POM-Vs can only be prescribed by veterinary surgeons for administration to animals under their care of a veterinary surgeon. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons requires that a number of criteria should be met for an animal to fall into this category:
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>The veterinary surgeon should have been given responsibility for the animal's health by its owner or guardian.</li>
        <li>The veterinary surgeon should have performed a clinical examination of the animal for the purpose of diagnosis or prescription, or have visited the premises in which the animal is kept sufficiently often and recently enough to have sufficient personal knowledge to make a diagnosis and prescribe for the animal in question.</li>

        </p>

    <p>POM-Vs may also be supplied by a pharmacist or another registered veterinary surgeon but only on production of a written prescription from the animal owner's veterinary surgeon.</p>


    <h2 class="sub-heading">POM-VPS</h2>
        <p>
            A clinical assessment is not necessarily required prior to prescription of POM-VPS. This category corresponds closely to the former PML (Pharmacy Merchants List) group of medicines. Medicines in this category can only be prescribed by a registered qualified person (RQP). A RQP is defined as a:

            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>Registered Veterinary Surgeon</li> 
                <li>Registered Pharmacist</li>
                <li>Registered Suitably Qualified Person (SQP).</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">POM-V</h2>
        <p>Medicinal products under this category may be supplied by any retailers (including supermarkets and pet shops) with no restrictions on supply. This category corresponds closely to the former GSL (General Sales List).
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Health and Safety requirements for medicines</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to the considerations above, medicines are also controlled by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSSH) Regulations 2002 (enacted under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974). COSHH regulations relate to work involving substances that are deemed to be hazardous to health and includes veterinary medicines and other substances produced by animals (blood, tissue, urine, faeces). It is the employer's responsibility to perform a risk assessment of each of these substances. Manufacturers of veterinary products provide a product safety data sheet to aid such risk assessment. The employer must prevent or control exposure of employees to these substances by information, instruction and training.
        </p>


        <h2 class="sub-heading">Withdrawal periods for drugs (Food producing animals)</h2>

<p>The Animals, Meat and Meat Products (Examination for Residues and Maximum Residue Limits) Regulations 1997 control residues of animal medicines in food producing animals. Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) are set which aim to avoid toxicity in man and technical problems for the food producing industries. Under EU legislation the MRL is defined as:
    Maximum concentration of residue resulting from administration of an animal medicine which is legally permitted in the Community or recognised as acceptable in or on a food.
    Withdrawal periods for meat and milk are listed on the data sheet accompanying the drug and must be strictly observed. Withdrawal periods are defined as:
    The time between the last dose given to the animal and the time when the level of residues in the tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, skin/fat) or products (milk, eggs, honey) is lower than or equal to the MRL.
    Withdrawal periods are given for time after administration to slaughter (meat production), and time from administration to milk entering the bulk tank or being used for human consumption. Where a withdrawal period is not given for a species a minimum of the following "standard" withdrawal periods should be adopted; 28 days for meat and 7 days for milk.
    Additionally, some organic food schemes require the doubling or tripling of data sheet and standard withdrawal periods.</p>
