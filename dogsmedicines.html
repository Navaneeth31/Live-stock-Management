    <p>1. Metronidazole has not been approved by the FDA for animals, but it is quite often prescribed for Giardia infection. The typical dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg PO q12 hours for 5 to 7 days.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>
            Metronidazole (also known by the brand names Flagyl, Metizol, Protostat, Metrogel) is a strong antibiotic primarily used as an antidiarrheal to treat inflammation of the large intestine.
            It’s also used for other illnesses and conditions in dogs, cats, and horses, as well as to treat bacterial infections in humans. It is often prescribed in combination with other antibiotics.
        </li>
            <li>
            <p>What Is Metronidazole Used For?
                Metronidazole treats bacterial infections and some parasites, so it is prescribed to treat a variety of conditions and to relieve their symptoms. It’s often used to treat:</p>
            </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Giardia (and other parasites)</li>
                <li>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</li>
                <li>Oral and dental infections</li>
                <li>Other bacterial infections that cause diarrhea or sepsis, abscesses, meningitis</li>
            </ul>
        



    </ul>


<br>


<h2 class="sub-heading">Famotidine</h2>

    <a href=""><img src="https://www.svpmeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/famotidine_10mg_mL_injection_01.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="400"></a>




    <p>2. Famotidine is frequently prescribed along with metronidazole to help with an upset belly. The usual dose is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO q12 to 24 hours.
        <h2>Prescribing categories</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Famotidine injection dogs and cats is commonly prescribed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of gastric, abomasal and duodenal ulcers, 
                uremic gastritis, stress-related or drug-induced erosive gastritis, esophagitis, duodenal gastric reflux, and esophageal reflux</li> 

            </ul>
    </p>


    <h2 class="sub-heading">Diphenhydramine</h2>
    <a href=""><img src="https://cf-s3.petcoach.co/uploads/canigive/7/1506529485-benadryl.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="300"></a>

    <P>
        3. Diphenhydramine is regularly used to treat acute allergy symptoms. It is dosed routinely as 2 to 4 mg/kg PO q8-12 hours.
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Diphenhydramine is given by mouth in the form of a tablet, capsule, oral liquid, or liquid injection. The oral formulations can be given with or without food.
             If your pet vomits after dosing on an empty stomach, give future doses with food or a treat. The liquid has a bad taste to cats, and administration by mouth may be difficult.
              The injection is typically given in the hospital, 
             either in the vein, muscle, or under the skin.

            This medication will take effect quickly, in about 1 to 2 hours, and improvement in clinical signs should follow</li>
        <li>If you miss a dose, give it when you remember, but if it is close to the time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and give it at the next scheduled time,
            and return to the regular dosing schedule. Never give your pet two doses at once or give extra doses.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Doxepin</h2>
    <a href=""><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/yhst-135855760451349/doxepin-100-mg-100-caps-manufacture-may-vary-43.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="300"></a>
<p> 4. Doxepin is prescribed to help treat anxiety but also to help with chronic allergies. The average dose range is 3 to 5 mg/kg PO q8-12 hours.

    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Diphenhydramine is given by mouth in the form of a tablet, capsule, oral liquid, or liquid injection. The oral formulations can be given with or without food.
             If your pet vomits after dosing on an empty stomach, give future doses with food or a treat. The liquid has a bad taste to cats, and administration by mouth may be difficult.
              The injection is typically given in the hospital, 
             either in the vein, muscle, or under the skin.

            This medication will take effect quickly, in about 1 to 2 hours, and improvement in clinical signs should follow</li>
        <li>If you miss a dose, give it when you remember, but if it is close to the time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and give it at the next scheduled time,
            and return to the regular dosing schedule. Never give your pet two doses at once or give extra doses.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Tramadol</h2>
        <a href=""><img src="https://mypetz.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1043010430882.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="300"></a>

        <p>
            5. Tramadol is commonly prescribed for pain in dogs. The typical dose is 2 to 5 mg/kg q6-12 hours.

            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>Tramadol is a medication veterinarians commonly dispense to manage pain in dogs. Physicians also frequently prescribe tramadol for human aches and pains, 
                    and it’s one of the few human painkillers that’s safe to give to dogs under the guidance of a veterinarian.</li> 
                <li>Like most opioids, tramadol is used to treat pain. The Merck Veterinary Manual recommends using tramadol to treat “acute and chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity,” which could mean anything from helping your dog recover from surgery or to help manage the pain associated with osteoarthritis when taken with other medications.
                    Your veterinarian might prescribe tramadol if your dog has any of the following causes of pain:
                    <li>osteoarthritis</li>
                    <li>Nonsurgical intervertebral disc disease</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Prednisone</h2>
        <a href=""><img src="https://petcancersociety.com/wp-content/uploads/prednisone-400.png" alt="Cinque Terre" width="500" height="300"></a>
        <p>6. Prednisone is often used for dogs as an anti-inflammatory and as an immunosuppressant. The dose ranges widely but usually starts at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg per day.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>A low dose of prednisone reduces inflammation and allergic reactions while providing mild pain relief; whereas, a high dose suppresses the immune system 
                and is used to treat autoimmune disease. It is also used for palliative care in dogs with cancer and helps to slow metastasis and stimulate red blood cell 
                production while restoring appetite.Prednisone is used to treat the following ailments</li>

                <li>Allergic disorders</li>
                <li>Skin conditions</li>
                <li>Ulcerative colitis</li>
                <li>Arthritis</li>
                <li>Lupus</li>
                <li>Skin diseases such as psoriasis or dermatitis.</li>
