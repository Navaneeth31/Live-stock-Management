                            and therefore causes sedation, muscular relaxation and a reduction in spontaneous activity. It acts rapidly, exerting a prompt and pronounced calming effect. It is an effective pre-anesthetic 
                            agent and lowers the dosage requirement of general anesthetics. Acepromazine Maleate Injection may be given intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The general dosage of Acepromazine Maleate 
                            Injection for horses is 2-4 mg per 100 lbs body weight; dogs 0.25-0.5 mg per lb body weight; for cats 0.5-1.0 mg per lb body weight. Acepromazine Maleate..</p>
